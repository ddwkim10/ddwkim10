With 20+ years of progressively responsible IT experience coupled with 13+ years in a university setting, I have the key following strengths:

1. In-depth knowledge of computer technology including embedded systems and IoT which has resulted in 5 registered patents.

2. Expertise leading the development of sophisticated wireless communication solutions and network-management infrastructures 
   including network-management software for a high-performance FDDI backbone switch GIGAswitch/FDDI, which has been one of the 
   most sold Internet-backbone switches ever.

3. Designed a simulation model for RFID IP core with ID filtering function using Verilog and Xilinks ISE
